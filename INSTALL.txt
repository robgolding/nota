To install nota, run the following command inside this directory:

    python setup.py install

Or if you'd prefer you can simply place the included `nota'
directory somewhere on your Python path, or symlink to it from
somewhere on your Python path; this is useful if you're working from a
clone of the repository.

Note that this application requires Pandoc 1.1 or later. You can
obtain Pandoc from http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/.
